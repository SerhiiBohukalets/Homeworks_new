<p><b>This template is a modified version of <a href="#">tristar's original</a></b></p>
<h2>changes.</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li>Page hyperlinks are a bit easier to notice</li>
    <li>Made the green menu slightly darker so that the white links are easier to see </li>
    <li>Fluid design</li>
    <li>Code redone (not that I am saying mine is better, I just like coding my own way)</li>
    <li>Gradients resize with font</li>
    <li>More user friendly </li>
    <li>Different banner to accomodate for the fluid layout (original wasn't wide enough)</li>
</ul>
<p>To view the source of this banner, see picture <a href="#">485493</a>  at <a href="#">sxc.hu</a> </p>
<h2>design.notes</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li>800x600 and up (Can stretch to 2000px wide without the banner running out) </li>
    <li>looks great! (not open to subjective dispute)</li>
    <li>Valid html/css</li>     
    <li>Tested and ok in IE55, E6, Firefox 1.51, Opera 8.53 (although IE55 has a small bug, but it still looks fine)</li>
 </ul>   
    <p>A problem with fud designs is that once the content stretches wide, the line lengths become rather long, and are harder to read. Hopefully because the Ap
content on this is 75% wide, the line lengths do not become too wide/</p>
